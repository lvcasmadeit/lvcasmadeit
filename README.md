**Computer Science & Data Science undergrad** at the **University of Massachusetts Lowell**  
**Vice-President** of the **UML Data Club** (2025–present)

Welcome to my GitHub! This is where I dump everything from class projects and competition notebooks to random experiments that probably sounded cooler at 2 a.m. than they actually are.

### 🔬 What I'm Currently Into
- Machine learning & deep learning (especially NLP and CV)
- Anything that lets me combine Python with questionable amounts of coffee
- Teaching and mentoring – I help run workshops and events through the UML Data Club
